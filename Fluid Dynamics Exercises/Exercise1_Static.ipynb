    "\n",
    "First imagine a can fully submerged in water. Recall from the gauge pressure formula, that as you go deeper the pressure increases ($P_{gauge} = \\rho g h$). Because of this fact the fully submerged can will experience a greater pressure in the bottom part compare to the top part. Hence, this difference pressure of the top part and bottom part create a net upward force that we will call the buoyant force. Below is how we derive the buoyant force from the pressure gradient \n",

    "    F_{buoyant} & = F_{up} - F_{down} \\quad \\quad \\text{Recall pressure is define as } P = F/A \\, -> F = PA \\\\\n",
    "    F_{buoyant} & = P_{bot} A - P_{top} A \\quad \\quad \\text{For the sake of discussion, we let } A_{top} = A_{bot} = A \\\\\n",
    "    F_{buoyant} & = \\rho g h_{bot} A - \\rho g h_{top} A \\quad \\quad \\text{Recall the gauge pressure formula} P_{gauge} = \\rho g h \\\\\n",
    "    F_{buoyant} & = \\rho g A (h_{bot} - h_{top}) \\quad \\quad \\text{The height difference of top and bottom is just the height of the can} \\\\\n",
    "    F_{buoyant} & = \\rho g A h_{can} \\\\\n",
    "    F_{buoyant} & = \\rho g V_{can} = \\rho g V_{disp} \\quad \\quad \\text{only true when the object is fully submerge}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "But is the volume $V$ should be only be the volume displace $V_{disp}$ by the object? \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, that is right and when the object is fully submerged $V_{can} = V_{disp}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, lets look on the case where a can is not fully submerge and only the part of $h_{sub}$ is submerge. The pressure on the top $P_{top}$ will reduce to $0$ if we are talking about gauge pressure $P_{gauge}$ or equal to atmospheric pressure $P_{atm}$ if we are want the absolute pressure $P_{abs}$. Since above derivation we use the gauge pressure, we can say that the $P_{top} = 0$. This will result to  \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    F_{buoyant} & = P_{bot} A - P_{top} A \\quad \\quad \\text{For the sake of discussion, we say } A_{top} = A_{bot} = A \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "Lastly, if we think a case where a liquid pressure are equal at all depths, because of the gauge pressure $P_{gauge} = \\rho g h$, this is only happen when the gravity is switch off $g=0$ or the density of the fluid is very near $\\rho = 0$. At those cases, the value of $F_{buoyant}$ will also be $0$ since it is also dependent to those variables."
